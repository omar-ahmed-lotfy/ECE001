    <h1>The future of AI</h1>
    <h3>Artificial intelligence, robotics, and the pursuit of self-confident systems. Part one of two articles on robotics and AI by Mark James, who spent 30 years developing advanced software systems for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and is now a CTO for Beyond Limits, a southern California AI engineering company.</h3>
    <h2>Early days for smart robots..</h2>
    <h3>Today we use both robots and artificial intelligence but the two are not yet fully merged. We are in the early days of the intelligent machine evolutionary saga. For example, factories are filled with not-too-smart robots which fulfill their destiny by fastening bolt after bolt, welding after welding.Elsewhere, numerous tech firms are starting to introduce 'embryonic' AI systems, which are doing nothing more now than flapping their metaphorical machine learning wings. They have no sense of situation.</h3>
