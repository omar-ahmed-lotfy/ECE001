    <h3>The Artificial Intelligence refers to computer intelligence. This is in contrast to the natural human and animal intelligence. Machines do functions such as learning , planning, reasoning and problem-solving with Artificial Intelligence. Most notable, Artificial Intelligence is machine-based simulation of human intelligence. It is probably the fastest-growing technology and innovation development in the world. Additionally, many experts agree that AI can overcome major problems and crisis situations.Artificial intelligence is the process by which the human processes are simulated by machines (especially computer systems). Some of the human processes simulated by the computers include reasoning, learning and self-correction. By installing vision capabilities, speech recognition capabilities and expert systems in the machines, these processes are made possible.In terms of speed , accuracy and capability, artificial intelligence allows machines to perform better or equal to humans. Video games are a major usage of artificial intelligence, with one computer acting as an opponent player in a game.</h3>
